# Uno in Python!
Currently in development, with a bunch of bugs. Please help contribute!

Also I'm very new to GitHub. I don't really make things here. If I do, i just take it down after a few minutes because I don't really know what to do with this.

I try to have this follow the rules of Uno, with no special rules such as the 7's Rule or stacking. However, if you are willing to try to add an optional rule, go right ahead. Be sure to somehow add them to the `game.rules` dictionary. Still don't know how I'd implement it though.
## Running the Program

Just run it in python with this (or something):
```py
import Uno
Uno.main(int(input('Enter the amount of players (minimum 2): ')))
```
or this in the terminal:
```
$ python3 /file/path/Uno.py
```
